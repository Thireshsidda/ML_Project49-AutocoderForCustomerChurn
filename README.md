# ML_Project49-AutocoderForCustomerChurn

### Customer Churn Prediction with Variational Autoencoders
This repository implements a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for predicting customer churn in a telecommunications dataset. The VAE learns a compressed representation of the customer data and uses it to reconstruct the original data, while also identifying potential churners.

### Project Overview
This project addresses the problem of customer churn prediction by leveraging the capabilities of VAEs. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

#### Data Preprocessing:
Loads the Telco customer churn dataset.

Cleans and preprocesses the data, handling missing values and encoding categorical features.

#### Autoencoder Model:
Implements a VAE architecture with an encoder and decoder network.

The encoder maps the input data to a latent space, capturing the underlying features.

The decoder reconstructs the original data from the latent representation.

#### Training and Evaluation:
Trains the VAE model on the training data and evaluates its performance on the validation set.

Employs early stopping to prevent overfitting.

#### Getting Started
Clone the Repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-churn-vae.git
```

#### Install Dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Project Structure
#### The project is organized as follows:
data: Contains the Telco customer churn dataset.

models: Houses the VAE model architecture and decoder model.

utils: Includes helper functions for data preprocessing and loss calculation.

main.py: The main script that loads data, trains the VAE model, and evaluates its performance.

requirements.txt: Lists the required Python libraries.

### Next Steps

Evaluate Model Performance: Analyze the model's performance on the test set using relevant metrics.

Visualize Latent Space: Visualize the latent space using dimensionality reduction techniques to understand data representation.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different hyperparameters to potentially improve model performance.

Feature Importance: Analyze decoder weights to identify features crucial for churn prediction.

This project provides a solid foundation for building a customer churn prediction model using VAEs. Feel free to explore further enhancements and customizations based on your specific needs.
